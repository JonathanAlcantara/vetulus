# Contributing

I am not stringent with that. Just Fork, modify and send me a Pull Request. Do
not forget to write tests and describe well what is your contribution. It will
simplify the review process.

## Code style guide

This project follows the [Google C++ Style
Guide](https://google.github.io/styleguide/cppguide.html).

## Commit messages

For good git logging history, we use simple titles. If more information is
necessary write it at the commit body. You can check [this
post](https://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/) for a good
reading about the topic. Here follows one example:

```
Manager: Add method to compute something

Creates new method to compute something with the given set of inputs.
The method returns the computed value.
```

Imagine that your commit message should complete the following sentence:

```
If applied, this commit will *your commit message*
```
